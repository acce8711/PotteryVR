challenges faced:
figuring out how to scale the pottery piece without scaling it in  both sides
    -just scale the empty parent
having a nice architecture
    -would've been useful to create an architecture design before begging coding
challenges with parent/child scaling    
    - scaling piece up
    -had scale values on wheel which was affecting te piece
parent doesn't detect clicks because it's technically empty?
used cannon.js for physics but the collision detection did nt have an event for the collision start
    - resulted in not being able to delete element
    -switched over to Ammo js which has no documentation but has more collision events
        -luckily got the needed info from the gitHub

what went well:
-accessing component properties through arrow functions
-when a property for a component that I needed already existed (ex: camera zoom)
-appreciate that it's possible to access the three js layer since it has so much more documentation
