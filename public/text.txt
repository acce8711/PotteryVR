challenges faced:
figuring out how to scale the pottery piece without scaling it in  both sides
    -just scale the empty parent
having a nice architecture
    -would've been useful to create an architecture design before begging coding
challenges with parent/child scaling    
    - scaling piece up
    -had scale values on wheel which was affecting te piece

what went well:
-accessing component properties through arrow functions
-when a property for a component that I needed already existed (ex: camera zoom)
-appreciate that it's possible to access the three js layer since it has so much more documentation
