# PotteryVR - A pottery destroying expererience 

🏺A pottery-destroying experience that explores emotional attachment to art, or simply lets you blow off some steam.

## Overview
This project was created as part of a third-year design studio course, where our objective was to create a VR experience to get familiar with the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) framework. I was inspired by my own experience with pottery. Throughout my pottery journey, I’ve learned not to get too attached to my pieces, as they’re fragile and can easily break. I wanted to reflect that reality in an interactive WebVR experience where users intentionally destroy their pottery creations.
