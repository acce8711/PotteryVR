# üè∫ PotteryVR ‚Äì A Pottery-Destroying Experience

A pottery-destroying experience that explores emotional attachment to art, or simply lets you break some stuff.

## Overview

This project was created as part of a two-week solo assignment for a third-year design studio course, where our objective was to create a VR experience to get familiar with the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) framework. 

I was inspired by my own experience with pottery. Throughout my pottery journey, I‚Äôve learned not to get too attached to my pieces, as they‚Äôre fragile and can easily break. I wanted to reflect that reality in an interactive WebVR experience where users intentionally destroy their pottery creations.
