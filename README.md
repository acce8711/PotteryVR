# PotteryVR

A pottery-destroying experience that challenges our emotional attachment to art.

## Overview

This project was inspired by my own experience with pottery. In every class, we’re told not to get too attached to our pieces since they’re fragile and can easily break. I wanted to reflect that reality in an interactive WebVR experience where users intentionally destroy their pottery creations.
